I understand you're experiencing [brief issue summary].

**Template 2: Plugin Conflict**
```
Subject: Re: Plugin Conflict

Hi [Name],

This sounds like it might be a plugin conflict. Let's troubleshoot:

1. Temporarily deactivate all other plugins
2. Check if A-Tables works correctly
3. If yes, reactivate plugins one by one
4. Identify which plugin causes the conflict

Common conflicts we've seen:
- Caching plugins (clear cache after updates)
- Security plugins (whitelist A-Tables AJAX calls)
- Page builders (ensure A-Tables shortcodes allowed)

Let me know what you find!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

**Template 3: Import Issues**
```
Subject: Re: Import Not Working

Hi [Name],

Import issues are usually related to:

1. File format not supported → Use CSV, XLSX, JSON, or XML
2. File too large → Check PHP upload limit (default 2MB)
3. Column headers missing → First row should contain headers
4. Special characters → Save file as UTF-8

Can you:
1. Share your WordPress PHP memory limit (WP Admin → Site Health)
2. Try with a small sample file (10 rows)
3. Check for JavaScript errors (F12 → Console)

Happy to help debug this!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```
