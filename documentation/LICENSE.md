**Q: Can I use on unlimited client sites?**
A: No, one license per website. For multiple sites, buy multiple licenses or contact us for volume licensing.

**Q: Can I use on staging site?**
A: Yes! Development/staging sites don't count, only production sites.

**Q: Can I use after support expires?**
A: Yes! Plugin continues working, you get updates, but support expires after 6 months (can be extended).
